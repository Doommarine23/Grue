Grue
====

Grue is a JavaScript library for constructing interactive fiction games. It provides a 
World, Regions, Rooms, and other standard IF constructs. Grue ties its objects together 
using a combination of simple events and jQuery-like selectors. The goal is to provide a 
fluent, straightforward interface that makes setting scenes and cueing up actions as easy as 
possible.
